<p><b>About</b></p>

<p>I am a Professor of Economics at TED University. I am also affiliated with
IZA and ERF as a Research Fellow. Before joining TED University, I served as a Deputy Governor,
Head of Structural Economic Research, Deputy Head of Research and Monetary
Policy, Economist, and Analyst at the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey
between 2002-2021.</p>

<p>I am interested in Applied Microeconomics with a focus on Labor

My research draws on techniques in Causal Inference, Structural Econometrics,
Machine Learning, and Bayesian Models.</p>
